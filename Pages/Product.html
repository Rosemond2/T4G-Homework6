Garden egg is indigenous to <b><i>sub-Sahara Africa</i></b>and can be stored for up to three months by allowing it to dry, which is particularly useful in tropical regions where refrigerators may be limited. In Ghana, garden egg is one of the <b><i>three most consumed vegetables,</i></b> alongside tomatoes and peppers. It is used in stews and can also be eaten raw. Interestingly, the stems and the leaves of garden eggs are consumed in some part of Arican countries, although not in Ghana. Due to its spongy texture, garden egg is sometimes used as a less expensive meat subtitute, as it absorbs other flavours well.
